# Hangman_Game
Hangman is a guessing game for two or more players.The word to guess is represented by a row of dashes representing each letter of the word.If the guessing player suggests a letter which occurs in the word, the other player writes it in all its correct positions
If the suggested letter does not occur in the word, then he loses his one life
 if the guesser makes enough incorrect guesses to allow the other player to complete the diagram, the guesser loses. However, the guesser can also win by guessing all the letters that appear in the word, thereby completing the word, before the diagram is completed.
